# tic-tac-toe
An extremely concise implementation of reinforcement learning to play tic tac toe with Q-learning or Sarsa.

I was having fun at making the code this short, so please accept my apologies for some short-cuts, and mixing types :) The computer didn't object though and was happy playing, so maybe it's more of a human mind's limitation than the actual issue ;)
